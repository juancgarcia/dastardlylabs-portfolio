Working on a home/apartment multi-zone temperature logging system based on [SparkCore](http://spark.io) modules reading temperature sensors that post data to a node server for analysis.    
   
Check out some slightly outdated code on github:   
   
[TemperatureLogger](https://github.com/juancgarcia/TemperatureLogger) - SparkCore firmware that reads a DS18b20 temperature sensor and publishes to a REST API
[https://github.com/juancgarcia/TemperatureLogger](https://github.com/juancgarcia/TemperatureLogger)   
   
[trackr](https://github.com/juancgarcia/trackr) - The nodejs server. This repo is using the ActionHero framework, but I've since peeled that back on my local development and made a more hand-coded REST API since I didn't yet need all the bells&whistles of ActionHero.
